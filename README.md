Redwood was developed at Stanford by students in the Stanford NLP Group.
A tutorial in `docs/tutorial.pdf`, presented to the group, provides a good
introduction to the theory and use of Redwood. It also motivates what types
of projects would fit well into the paradigm.

Redwood is a hierarchical channel based logger. Log messages are arranged
hierarchically by depth (e.g. `main->tagging->sentence 2`) using the `startTrack()`
and `endTrack()` methods. Furthermore, messages can be flagged with a number of
channels, which allow filtering by channel. Log levels are implemented as
channels (`ERROR`, `WARNING`, etc).

Details on the handlers used are documented in their respective classes, which
all implement `LogRecordHandler`. New handlers should implement this class.

Details on configuring Redwood can be found in the `RedwoodConfiguration` class.
New configuration methods should be implemented in this class, following the
standard builder paradigm.
